\arguments{
\item{.data}{The dataset containing the columns related to Environments,
Genotypes, replication/block and response variable(s).}

\item{env}{The name of the column that contains the levels of the
environments.}

\item{gen}{The name of the column that contains the levels of the genotypes.}

\item{rep}{The name of the column that contains the levels of the
replications/blocks.}

\item{resp}{The response variable(s). To analyze multiple variables in a
single procedure a vector of variables may be used. For example \code{resp
  = c(var1, var2, var3)}.}

\item{block}{Defaults to \code{NULL}. In this case, a randomized complete
block design is considered. If block is informed, then an alpha-lattice
design is employed considering block as random to make use of inter-block
information, whereas the complete replicate effect is always taken as
fixed, as no inter-replicate information was to be recovered (Mohring et
al., 2015).}

\item{random}{The effects of the model assumed to be random. Defaults to
\code{random = "gen"}. See \strong{Details} to see the random effects
assumed depending on the experimental design of the trials.}

\item{prob}{The probability for estimating confidence interval for BLUP's
prediction.}

\item{verbose}{Logical argument. If \code{verbose = FALSE} the code will run
silently.}
}

random-effect models.

\details{
The nature of the effects in the model is chosen with the argument
\code{random}. By default, the experimental design considered in each
environment is a randomized complete block design. If \code{block} is
informed, a resolvable alpha-lattice design (Patterson and Williams, 1976) is
implemented. The following six models can be fitted depending on the values
of \code{random} and \code{block} arguments.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Model 1:} \code{block = NULL} and \code{random = "gen"} (The
default option). This model considers a Randomized Complete Block Design in
each environment assuming genotype and genotype-environment interaction as
random effects. Environments and blocks nested within environments are
assumed to fixed factors.
\item \strong{Model 2:} \code{block = NULL} and \code{random = "env"}. This
model considers a Randomized Complete Block Design in each environment
treating environment, genotype-environment interaction, and blocks nested
within environments as random factors. Genotypes are assumed to be fixed
factors.
\item \strong{Model 3:} \code{block = NULL} and \code{random = "all"}. This
model considers a Randomized Complete Block Design in each environment
assuming a random-effect model, i.e., all effects (genotypes, environments,
genotype-vs-environment interaction and blocks nested within environments)
are assumed to be random factors.
\item \strong{Model 4:} \code{block} is not \code{NULL} and \code{random =
  "gen"}. This model considers an alpha-lattice design in each environment
assuming genotype, genotype-environment interaction, and incomplete blocks
nested within complete replicates as random to make use of inter-block
information (Mohring et al., 2015). Complete replicates nested within
environments and environments are assumed to be fixed factors.
\item \strong{Model 5:} \code{block} is not \code{NULL} and \code{random =
  "env"}. This model considers an alpha-lattice design in each environment
assuming genotype as fixed. All other sources of variation (environment,
genotype-environment interaction, complete replicates nested within
environments, and incomplete blocks nested within replicates) are assumed
to be random factors.
\item \strong{Model 6:} \code{block} is not \code{NULL} and \code{random =
  "all"}. This model considers an alpha-lattice design in each environment
assuming all effects, except the intercept, as random factors.
