\description{
Plot heat maps with genotype ranking in two ways.
}
\details{
The first type of heatmap shows the genotype ranking depending on the number
of principal component axis used for estimating the WAASB index. The second type of heatmap shows the
genotype ranking depending on the WAASB/GY ratio. The ranks obtained with a
ratio of 100/0 considers exclusively the stability for the genotype ranking.
On the other hand, a ratio of 0/100 considers exclusively the productivity
for the genotype ranking.  Four clusters of genotypes are shown by label colors (red) unproductive and
unstable genotypes; (blue) productive, but unstable genotypes; (black) stable, but
unproductive genotypes; and (green), productive and stable genotypes.
