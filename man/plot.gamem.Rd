\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{gamem}.}

\item{var}{The variable to plot. Defaults to \code{var = 1} the first
variable of \code{x}.}

\item{type}{If \code{type = 're'}, normal Q-Q plots for the random effects
are obtained.}

\item{conf}{Level of confidence interval to use in the Q-Q plot (0.95 by
default).}

\item{out}{How the output is returned. Must be one of the 'print' (default)
or 'return'.}

\item{n.dodge}{The number of rows that should be used to render the x labels.
This is useful for displaying labels that would otherwise overlap.}

\item{check.overlap}{Silently remove overlapping labels, (recursively)
prioritizing the first, last, and middle labels.}

\item{labels}{Logical argument. If \code{TRUE} labels the points outside
confidence interval limits.}

\item{plot_theme}{The graphical theme of the plot. Default is
\code{plot_theme = theme_metan()}. For more details, see
\code{\link[ggplot2]{theme}}.}

\item{alpha}{The transparency of confidence band in the Q-Q plot. Must be a
number between 0 (opaque) and 1 (full transparency).}

\item{fill.hist}{The color to fill the histogram. Default is 'gray'.}

\item{col.hist}{The color of the border of the the histogram. Default is
'black'.}

\item{col.point}{The color of the points in the graphic. Default is 'black'.}

\item{col.line}{The color of the lines in the graphic. Default is 'red'.}

\item{col.lab.out}{The color of the labels for the 'outlying' points.}

\item{size.lab.out}{The size of the labels for the 'outlying' points.}

\item{size.tex.lab}{The size of the text in axis text and labels.}

\item{size.shape}{The size of the shape in the plots.}

\item{bins}{The number of bins to use in the histogram. Default is 30.}

\item{which}{Which graphics should be plotted. Default is \code{which =
c(1:4)} that means that the first four graphics will be plotted.}

\item{ncol, nrow}{The number of columns and rows of the plot pannel. Defaults
to \code{NULL}}

\item{align}{Specifies whether graphs in the grid should be horizontally
(\code{"h"}) or vertically (\code{"v"}) aligned. \code{"hv"} (default)
align in both directions, \code{"none"} do not align the plot.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to the function
\code{\link[cowplot]{plot_grid}}}
}
\description{
Residual plots for a output model of class \code{gamem}. Six types of plots
are produced: (1) Residuals vs fitted, (2) normal Q-Q plot for the residuals,
(3) scale-location plot (standardized residuals vs Fitted Values), (4)
standardized residuals vs Factor-levels, (5) Histogram of raw residuals and
(6) standardized residuals vs observation order. For a \code{waasb} object,
normal Q-Q plot for random effects may also be obtained declaring \code{type
= 're'}
