\usage{
Smith_Hazel(.data, pcov = NULL, gcov = NULL, SI = 15, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The input data. It can be either a two-way table with genotypes
in rows and traits in columns, or an object fitted with the function
\code{\link{gamem}()}. Please, see \strong{Details} for more details.}

\item{pcov, gcov}{The phenotypic and genotypic variance-covariance matrix,
respectively. Defaults to \code{NULL}. If a two-way table is informed in
\code{.data} these matrices are mandatory.}

\item{SI}{The selection intensity (percentage). Defaults to \code{20}}

\item{weights}{The vector of economic weights. Defaults to a vector of 1s
with the same lenth of the number of traits.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{hz} containing:
\itemize{
\item \strong{b}: the vector of index coefficient.
\item \strong{index}: The genetic worth.
\item \strong{sel_dif}: The selection differencial.
\item \strong{sel_gen}: The selected genotypes.
\item \strong{gcov}: The genotypic variance-covariance matrix
\item \strong{pcov}: The phenotypic variance-covariance matrix
}
}
\description{
Computes the Smith (1936) and Hazel (1943) index given economic weights and
phenotypic and genotypic variance-covariance matrices. The Smith-Hazel index
is computed as follows:
\loadmathjax
\mjsdeqn{\bf{b = P^{-1}Aw}}

where \mjseqn{\bf{P}} and \mjseqn{\bf{G}} are phenotypic and genetic
covariance matrices, respectively, and \mjseqn{\bf{b}} and \mjseqn{\bf{w}}
are vectors of index coefficients and economic weightings, respectively.

The genetic worth \mjseqn{I} of an individual
genotype based on traits \emph{x}, \emph{y}, ..., \emph{n}, is calculated as:

\mjsdeqn{I = b_xG_x + b_yG_y + ... + b_nG_n}

where \emph{b} the index coefficient for the traits \emph{x}, \emph{y}, ...,
\emph{n}, respectively, and \emph{G} is the individual genotype BLUPs for the
traits \emph{x}, \emph{y}, ..., \emph{n}, respectively.
}
\details{
When using the phenotypic means in \code{.data}, be sure the genotype's code
are in rownames. If \code{.data} is an object of class \code{gamem} them the
BLUPs for each genotype are used to compute the index. In this case, the
genetic covariance components are estimated by mean cross products.
